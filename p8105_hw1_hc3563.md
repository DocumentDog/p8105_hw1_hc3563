### Problem 1

First, we need to download the plamerpenguins data set and load it.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Then, letâ€™s take a look at this data set. First, we want to know what
the data look like. First we will check all of the variable names in
this data set:species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. We also want to see the first
row of record:Adelie, Torgersen, 39.1, 18.7, 181, 3750, male, 2007.

For the size of data set, there are 344 rows and 8 columns.

We also want to know the mean of flipper length, which is 200.9152047,
and here is the scatterplot of flipper length and bill length:
