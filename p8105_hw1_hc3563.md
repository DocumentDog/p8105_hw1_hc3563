Let’s first load the necessary package:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

### Problem 1

First, we need to download the plamerpenguins data set and load it.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Then, let’s take a look at this data set. First, we want to know what
the data look like. First we will check all of the variable names in
this data set:species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year. We also want to see the first
row of record:Adelie, Torgersen, 39.1, 18.7, 181, 3750, male, 2007.

For the size of data set, there are 344 rows and 8 columns.

We also want to know the mean of flipper length, which is 200.9152047,
and here is the scatterplot of flipper length and bill length:

### Problem 2

Now we will create a dataframe that contains:

- random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0

- a character vector of length 10

- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
set.seed(42)
df = tibble(
  vec_num = rnorm(10, sd=1),
  vec_logic = vec_num > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", 'is', 'Hanchuan', 'Chen', 'and', 'my', 'UNI', 'is', 'hc3563'),
  vec_factor = c('high','low','low','medium','medium','low','high','medium','low','high')
)

show(df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_num vec_logic vec_char vec_factor
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>     <chr>    <chr>     
    ##  1  1.37   TRUE      My       high      
    ##  2 -0.565  FALSE     name     low       
    ##  3  0.363  TRUE      is       low       
    ##  4  0.633  TRUE      Hanchuan medium    
    ##  5  0.404  TRUE      Chen     medium    
    ##  6 -0.106  FALSE     and      low       
    ##  7  1.51   TRUE      my       high      
    ##  8 -0.0947 FALSE     UNI      medium    
    ##  9  2.02   TRUE      is       low       
    ## 10 -0.0627 FALSE     hc3563   high

And the mean for numeric variable is 0.5472968; mean for logical
variable is 0.6; mean for character variable is NA; and the mean for
factor variable is NA. As a result, numeric and logical variables can
calculate the mean while character and factor variables cannot.

Next, I am going to write a code chunk that converting variable type.

``` r
logic_to_num = as.numeric(df$vec_logic)
print(logic_to_num)

char_to_num = as.numeric(df$vec_char)
print(char_to_num)

factor_to_num = as.numeric(df$vec_factor)
print(factor_to_num)
```

From the result, we will see that logical variable can be converted to
numeric type, while character and factor variables cannot be converted
to numeric type. That is because logical values are inherently
represented that TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0. However, convert strings and
factors to numeric seems not make sense so they will return NA instead.
As a result, when calculating mean for each variables, only numeric and
logical variables can be calculated while other two variables cannot.
